"""
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator (Ollama-backed).

Replaces the transformers-based utils/llm_as_a_judge.py with an equivalent
that uses the Ollama HTTP API, so no local model weights are needed beyond
what Ollama manages.

The judge scores a single (prediction, ground_truth) pair as 0 or 1 and
returns a short rationale.  `evaluate()` runs the judge against all
ground truths and returns 1 if any passes.
